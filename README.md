## Installation
No installation required - this is a static website. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Customization
To modify the website:

1. Edit `index.html` for content changes
2. Modify the `<style>` section in the `<head>` for design changes
3. Update the JavaScript in the `<script>` tag at the bottom for behavior changes

Key customization points:
- Color scheme (edit Tailwind CSS classes)
- Content (update text in HTML)
- Images (replace placeholder image URLs)
- Contact form (would need backend integration for full functionality)

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements:
- Add backend functionality for the contact form
- Implement user accounts for the jobs platform
- Add database integration for job listings
- Create admin dashboard for content management
- Translate to Swahili and other local languages
